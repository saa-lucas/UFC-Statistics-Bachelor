# Python Data Treatment Course - SEst 2025 🐍
### Technical Outreach by Gauss Jr. (UFC Statistics Junior Enterprise)

This directory contains the documentation and technical materials for the "Data Treatment with Python" course delivered during the **Statistics Week (SEst) at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC)**.

## 📝 About the Course
The workshop focused on bridging the gap between statistical theory and practical data engineering. As the **Technical Coordinator at Gauss Jr.**, I designed and delivered this training to help undergraduate students master data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

## 📊 Technical Highlights
* **Data Wrangling**: Handling missing values, standardizing strings, and correcting data types.
* **Statistical Cleansing**: Detecting and treating outliers using Boxplots and Histograms.
* **Tooling**: Built entirely using the Python data stack: **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## 📉 Methodology & Results
Key visualizations demonstrating the data cleaning process performed during the workshop.

### 1. Outlier Treatment (Before vs. After)
This boxplot comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the interquartile range (IQR) method applied to the dataset. Note the scale correction in the second chart.
